/*  
                          Mobile-first development:

- Media breakpoints are based on Bootstrap's approach.

    1. Start with mobile styles (small screens) by default. 
       - X-Small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)
       - No media query for `xs` since this is the default in Bootstrap
    2. Write the base styles for mobile devices without any media queries.
    3. As the screen size increases, 
        - Use breakpoints (min-width) to target larger screen sizes progressively.  
        - Introduce new styles for larger screens.
